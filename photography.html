            <h2>About This Photography Journey</h2>
            <p>Welcome to <strong>Through the Lens</strong>, a personal collection of moments frozen in time. This website is born from a passion for capturing the beauty in ordinary moments and extraordinary places.</p>
            
            <div class="block-element">
                <p><em>Photography</em>, for me, began as a simple hobby but quickly evolved into a way of seeing the world differently. Each click of the shutter is a conversation with light, shadow, and emotion.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>This site showcases <strong>my favorite photographs</strong> collected over years of exploration. From urban landscapes to natural wonders, each image tells a unique story and holds a special memory.</p>
            
            <p>Through photography, I've learned that the most powerful images often come from paying attention to <em>the little things</em>—the way light filters through leaves, the unguarded smile of a stranger, or the intricate patterns in architecture that most people walk past without noticing.</p>
            
            <p>This website is more than just a gallery; it's an invitation to <strong>see the world through my lens</strong>, to appreciate the beauty in details, and to remember that every moment is worth capturing.</p>

            <h2>My First Photograph</h2>
            <ul class="photo-list">
                <li class="photo-item">
                    <img src="sunset.jpg" alt="A pic of the sunset" class="photo-img">

                        <h3>Dusk's Last Light</h3>
                        <p>Captured during a vacay in Mombasa. The way the sun sets was simply magical. This was taken in the evening</p>
                    </div>
                </li>

                        <p>Just a beautiful caption of a rainy evening.</p>

                        <h3>Wisdom in Wrinkles</h3>
                        <p>Maria, 94, in her garden in Portugal. Her eyes tell stories of a lifetime. This portrait taught me that beauty deepens with age, and every line on a face is a chapter of life.</p>
